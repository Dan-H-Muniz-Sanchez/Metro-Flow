# Metro-Flow
Metro-Flow This repository explores the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to uncover patterns in the flow and diffusion of passengers within a metro network. By analyzing transit data, we aim to provide insights into user behavior, network efficiency, and congestion dynamics.
